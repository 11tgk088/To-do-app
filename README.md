## 📝 To-Do List App (Vanilla JavaScript)

This is a simple and interactive **To-Do List Application** built using **HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to add, edit, and delete items efficiently while preventing duplicate entries.

### 🔧 Features

* ✅ **Add Tasks**
  Users can input a task name and click the "Add" button to create a new list item.

* 🚫 **Duplicate Prevention**
  Before adding, the app checks if the entered task name already exists (case-insensitive). If it does, an alert notifies the user.

* ✏️ **Edit & Update Tasks**
  Each task comes with an "Edit" button. Clicking it enables the text field and shows an "Update" button to confirm changes.

* 🧠 **Smart Update Validation**
  On updating, the app checks for:

  * Empty task names.
  * Duplicate task names (excluding the current one).

* ❌ **Delete Tasks**
  Users can delete tasks with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental removals.

* 🔁 **Clean UI & Bootstrap Styling**
  The layout uses Bootstrap classes for responsiveness and visual clarity.

### 📁 File Structure

* `index.html` → Contains the form input and unordered list where tasks appear.
* `script.js` → Contains all the logic for adding, editing, validating, and deleting tasks.
* `style.css` (optional) → Can be used for custom styling in addition to Bootstrap.

### 🛠 Tech Used

* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5
* Bootstrap 5
